using scikitLearn , here you will find a multiple machine learining models that uses different learning algorithms , either for supervised (logistic and linear regression) or unsupervised (clustring)  

notice : you modify dataSets or replace them your own dataSet however you should modify the codes a little , so that it fits with the changes .


Used algorithms :
gradient descent 
k-means algorithm

dataSets were tooken from differant sources such as kaggle , uci , or even from python libs
